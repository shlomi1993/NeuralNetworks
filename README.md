# NeuralNetworks
This repositories documents different neural networks I have implemented during Machine Learning course I took as part of my Computer Science studies at Bar-Ilan University.


## Description

Neural Networks are Machine Learning computing models inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.

A Neural Network (shortly NN) is based on a collection of connected computational units called neurons. Each connection can transmit a signal to other neurons. A neuron receives a signal then processes it and can signal neurons connected to it. The "signal" at a connection is a real number, and the output of each neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections are called edges. Neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Typically, neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer that is the input layer, through a number of hidden layers, to the last layer that is the output layer.

Here is an example of a simple NN with one hidden layer:

And here is an example of a multi-hidden-layer NN, or a Deep Neural Network (DNN):
